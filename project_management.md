## Plan 3a — 2024 WR sanity check (run 2026-04-25, on branch `feat/plan-3a-wr-model-a`)

Held-out year is 2024 not 2025 (spec called for 2025; `nfl_data_py` has not yet published 2025 data).

=== 2024 sanity check (n=2048 player-weeks) ===

-- Per-stat fit --
            receptions  rmse= 2.049  mae= 1.541  mean_pred= 2.900  mean_actual= 3.116
       receiving_yards  rmse=31.186  mae=22.946  mean_pred=36.331  mean_actual=39.204
         receiving_tds  rmse= 0.495  mae= 0.348  mean_pred= 0.212  mean_actual= 0.256
         rushing_yards  rmse= 3.945  mae= 1.917  mean_pred= 1.314  mean_actual= 1.005
           rushing_tds  rmse= 0.086  mae= 0.017  mean_pred= 0.010  mean_actual= 0.007
          fumbles_lost  rmse= 0.122  mae= 0.033  mean_pred= 0.018  mean_actual= 0.015

-- Composite (PPR points) --
  mean prediction:  rmse=6.775  mae=4.908
  top-N season-total rank correlation (Spearman, all WRs): 0.971

-- Calibration --
  fraction in [p10, p90]: 0.708  (target ~ 0.80)
  fraction <= p90:        0.816  (target ~ 0.90)
```

Soft-threshold check vs. spec §6.3:
- Spearman top-30 correlation ≥ 0.4 — **MET** (0.971 — very high, the model captures relative WR ranking well).
- Calibration `[p10, p90]` coverage in 70–90% range — **borderline MET** (70.8%; right at the lower bound). The predicted distributions are slightly too narrow (under-dispersed). Plan 3c's backtest harness can formalize this and motivate either MLE-fit gamma α (TODO note in spec §3.4) or per-stat residual variance buckets.
- Per-stat RMSE within 2× of naive-baseline RMSE — **n/a until we compute the naive baseline**; track for future.

Per-stat means are systematically slightly *under* actual (e.g., receptions 2.90 vs 3.12, receiving_yards 36.3 vs 39.2) — Ridge has shrunk toward the league mean, which is expected behavior. The bias is small enough that the rank correlation is preserved.

**Plan 3a deliverable: pipeline works end-to-end on real data.** Bad numbers would feed into Plan 3c's threshold-setting; the sanity numbers here are good enough that the pipeline is the load-bearing artifact, not the model itself.

## Current status (as of 2026-04-24)

**Projections Core — Plan 2b (QB/RB/TE feature builders) merged to `main` at commit `<TBD-after-merge>`.**

**Predecessors:**
- Plan 1 (Foundations) merged at `8f02a6c`.
- Dev tooling merged via `feat/dev-tooling`.
- Plan 2a (Ingest expansion + WR feature builder) merged at `7926090`.

**Plan 2b delivered:**
- `build_qb_features`, `build_rb_features`, `build_te_features` — pure-function builders mirroring `build_wr_features`'s shape.
- Three new feature schemas (`QbFeaturesSchema`, `RbFeaturesSchema`, `TeFeaturesSchema`).
- `WeeklyStatsSchema` extended with `attempts`, `completions`, `sacks` for QB features.
- Generalized `trailing_n_share_in_group` helper in `_rolling.py` (migrated from `wr.py`'s local helper).
- ~45 new tests (~200 total). 5 leakage tests per position (15 new).

## Next action

**Recommended: Plan 3 — Model A baseline + season aggregation + first-class backtest harness.**

All 4 offensive skill positions (QB/RB/WR/TE) now have feature builders. Plan 3 trains the v1 model per position, aggregates weekly outputs to season distributions (Monte Carlo with bye + availability), and stands up the backtest harness that gates future model changes.

K and DST builders (TODO #10) can land in parallel with Plan 3 — they're independent.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-24 | `rushing_qb` boolean threshold = 5.0 carries/game over trailing 4; `passing_down_back` = 4.0 targets/game | Rough heuristics from feel. Not load-bearing; revisit at backtest time if categorization matters |
| 2026-04-24 | TE target_share denominator includes WR + RB + TE (full pass-catching group) | TEs usually have only one fantasy-relevant player per team, so same-position-share would be ~1.0 and useless. Full-group share captures meaningful gradient |
| 2026-04-24 | RB target_share denominator includes WR + RB + TE (full pass-catching group) | A workhorse RB getting 5 targets/game on a 30-target offense is meaningfully different from one getting 5 on a 20-target offense. Full-group denominator captures team passing volume, not just RB-on-RB share |
| 2026-04-24 | Migrate `_trailing_4_share_per_team` from `wr.py` to `_rolling.py` as `trailing_n_share_in_group` | RB needs target_share against the full pass-catching group (not just RBs); TE needs the same. Generalize once, in the shared helper module, rather than duplicate in three builders |
| 2026-04-24 | Extend `WeeklyStatsSchema` with `attempts`, `completions`, `sacks` | QB feature builder needs these source columns. All three are present in raw `nfl_data_py.import_weekly_data` output. Same incremental pattern as 2a's extension for `targets`/`carries`/`receiving_air_yards` |
| 2026-04-24 | One bundled PR for QB/RB/TE (not three per-position PRs) | Repetitive, interlinked work; reviewing all three together catches drift. Each position lands as its own commit inside the bundle for easy retrospection |
| 2026-04-24 | All 4 position builders use parallel files (no WR/TE shared base) | Each position's feature list will diverge over time as we add play-by-play-derived features. Premature DRY hurts later. Shared logic lives in `_rolling.py` / `_opponent.py` |
| 2026-04-24 | K and DST split out into a future plan; 2b covers QB/RB/TE only | K needs FG-attempt data not in `WeeklyStatsSchema`; DST is team-level not player-level and needs play-by-play. Both should wait for the data they need rather than ship degraded v0 features |
| 2026-04-24 | `nfl_data_py.import_snap_counts` returns `pfr_player_id` not `gsis_id`; ingest joins on id_map | Discovered during fixture-construction (Task 8). Snap_counts ingest now reads id_map.parquet and inner-joins pfr_id → gsis_id; bench/practice players with no id_map match are dropped silently |
| 2026-04-24 | `spread_line` from `nfl_data_py` is positive when home favored (inverts standard sportsbook) | Discovered during code review of Task 15. Empirically verified against import_schedules([2023]). `_build_game_environment` in features/wr.py uses the empirically-correct convention; team-perspective `spread` follows standard "favorite is negative" |
| 2026-04-24 | Split Plan 2 into 2a (ingest expansion + WR feature builder) and 2b (QB / RB / TE / K / DST feature builders) | Validate the feature-builder pattern end-to-end on one position before copy-pasting across five files; isolate ingest (mechanical) from features (greenfield design) |
| 2026-04-24 | WR is the first end-to-end position | Exercises every new ingest source (snap_counts, depth_charts, NGS receiving) in one builder; surfaces design issues before propagating to other positions |
| 2026-04-24 | Feature builders are pure functions in 2a — no parquet storage | Output is small (~1.8K rows/season for WR) and computes in milliseconds; defer caching until backtest performance demands it (Plan 3+) |
| 2026-04-24 | Ingest all three NGS stat types (passing, rushing, receiving) in 2a, even though only NGS receiving is consumed by WR | The hard part of NGS ingest is the snapshot/partition decision; make it once across all three rather than three times |
| 2026-04-24 | Opponent strength via `opp_allowed_fppg_l4` proxy in 2a, not play-by-play EPA | True EPA needs play-by-play ingest (separate concern, deferred); the FPPG-allowed proxy is sufficient for v1 baseline |
| 2026-04-24 | Shared `_rolling.py` and `_opponent.py` helpers built and tested in 2a | Pin helper API on the first builder so 2b's five other builders consume a stable contract |
| 2026-04-24 | Schedule ingest captures Vegas lines (spread, total, moneyline) | "Implied team total" is a load-bearing feature for every offensive position |
| 2026-04-24 | Drive-by cleanups (`_PYARROW_STR` to `schemas.py`, programmatic `_INTEGER_STATS`, ingest `__all__`) folded into 2a | We're touching every ingest module anyway; cheaper to clean up once than across two PRs |
| 2026-04-24 | Extend `WeeklyStatsSchema` with `targets`, `receiving_air_yards`, `carries` | Discovered during plan-writing: WR feature builder needs these source columns and the foundations-era schema didn't include them. All three are present in raw `nfl_data_py.import_weekly_data` output |
| 2026-04-24 | Test fixtures are synthetic in-memory `pd.DataFrame`s, not real-data parquet snapshots | Matches existing convention from foundations (`fake_weekly_df` etc.); simpler maintenance; `nfl_data_py` API drift is handled separately by opt-in network smoke tests (TODO #8) |
| 2026-04-24 | Decompose project into 4 sub-projects (Projections Core, Draft Hub, Mid-season Manager, DFS Engine) | Each subsystem has different consumer logic; shared dependency is a probabilistic projection engine. Keeps any single design doc executable. |
| 2026-04-24 | Build Projections Core first | Earliest dependency for everything else. |
| 2026-04-24 | `nfl_data_py` as primary data source | Free, comprehensive, modern; Python-native. Paid feeds (PFF, FantasyPros API) deferred until we've validated need. |
| 2026-04-24 | Full per-player distributions (option C from brainstorming), not point estimates | Subsumes point estimates for free; required for DFS GPP work later. Joint correlations (option D) deferred to TODO #1 — schema designed so D is additive. |
| 2026-04-24 | Weekly model as foundation; season aggregates as derived layer | Weekly is where play-by-play signal lives; season is Monte Carlo aggregation with bye + availability. |
| 2026-04-24 | A → C → D modeling roadmap | Baseline regression first (Model A) to establish data pipeline + backtest harness; gradient boosted (Model C) only if it beats baseline; ensemble (Model D) reserved for last. |
| 2026-04-24 | Strong typing posture: pandera schemas at module boundaries, pydantic models for configs/records, NewType per ID flavor, mypy strict, enums for every reused string-keyed concept | User had prior pain with stringly-typed/dict-laden code. Catch errors at boundaries, not three modules deep. |
| 2026-04-24 | Parquet + DuckDB storage | Friendly to free-tier hosting (Streamlit Community Cloud, HF Spaces, DuckDB-WASM in browser). |
| 2026-04-24 | Subagent-driven execution for foundations plan | Faster iteration, fresh context per task, two-stage review (spec then code quality) at higher-risk tasks. |
| 2026-04-24 | Pre-commit hooks (ruff lint+format, mypy, housekeeping); no GitHub Actions CI; pytest manual before PR | Catches the regressions that matter at commit time without slowing commits with full pytest. CI deferred indefinitely per user direction. |
| 2026-04-24 | No direct commits to `main` — specs, plans, and implementation all on feature branch via PR | User correction after I committed a spec to main. Conventions encoded in CONTRIBUTING.md and CLAUDE.md. |
| 2026-04-24 | `CLAUDE.md` trimmed; `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the deep contributor doc | CLAUDE.md auto-loads into Claude's context every interaction; every line costs context budget. Detail moves to CONTRIBUTING.md. |

## Backlog (longer-term)

Roughly in order. Each is its own brainstorm → spec → plan cycle.

### Projections Core (remaining)

- **Plan 2** — Ingest expansion (schedules, snap_counts, depth_charts, NGS) + per-position feature builders.
- **Plan 3** — Model A baseline (per-position regressions) + season aggregation (Monte Carlo with bye + availability) + first-class backtest harness.
- **Plan 4** — Public Python API + CLI verbs (`refresh`, `project`, `backtest`, `query`) + free-tier web hosting setup (likely Streamlit on Community Cloud).
- **Plan 5** — Model C (LightGBM with quantile regression). Adopt only if it beats Model A on the backtest harness.

### Subsequent sub-projects

- **Draft Hub** — pre-draft rankings, ADP, tier breaks, VORP, mock-draft sim, live draft assistant (consumes Projections Core + ESPN league API).
- **Mid-season Manager** — weekly start/sit, waiver-wire valuator, trade analyzer, schedule strength.
- **DFS Engine** — slate projections, ownership, salary-constrained lineup optimizer, multi-lineup portfolio. Triggers TODO #1 (joint correlations) work.

### Cross-cutting

- **TODO #1** — option D exploration: joint-correlation projections (covariance / scenario sim / factor / copula). Decide before DFS Engine.
- **`score_distribution` vectorization** — TODO marker in code; needed before backtest scale (~85M Pydantic instantiations otherwise).
- Minor cleanups from foundations review: `_PYARROW_STR` to `schemas.py`, programmatic `_INTEGER_STATS`, drop ingest helpers from `__all__`.
- ESPN league API integration (year-long league sync). Belongs in Draft Hub / Mid-season Manager sub-projects.
- Pyarrow strings everywhere story: pandera 0.31 enforces `string[pyarrow]` for `Series[str]`. Consider whether a future schema or storage shift makes this implicit rather than per-module.
